        <h1>Division Event Logger Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how the Division Event Logger bot collects, uses, and shares information from users and Discord servers. By using the bot, you agree to the data practices described below.</p>

        <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>The Division Event Logger may collect the following types of data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Attendance</strong>: Information about which users attend events and the times they attend.</li>
            <li><strong>Server Presence</strong>: Data about which servers a user and the bot are both in.</li>
            <li><strong>User Invitations</strong>: Information on who invited a user to a specific server.</li>
            <li><strong>Server Settings</strong>: Configurations and settings that a server has customized for the botâ€™s functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Statistics</strong>: Data on user and server activities, including the number of events attended, hosted, and average attendance, as well as total event attendees, recruitment efforts, and similar statistics.</li>
            <li><strong>Roblox Group Association</strong>: Information about which Roblox group is linked to a specific Discord server, including details for rank tracking and promotions.</li>
            <li><strong>Channel-Function Links</strong>: Information about which Discord channels are linked to specific bot functions, such as where event logs should be sent or other functional integrations.</li>
            <li><strong>Role-Rank Links</strong>: Information about which Discord roles are associated with specific Roblox ranks for automated rank management and promotion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use the Data</h2>
        <p>The data collected by Division Event Logger is used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Event Tracking</strong>: To log user and server event participation for accurate event reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>Bot Functionality</strong>: To provide personalized and effective services based on server settings and user interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis and Aggregation</strong>: To derive additional statistics based on collected data. This may include calculations such as total event attendance, average event participation, user recruitment effectiveness, server-wide statistics (e.g., total events hosted, total attendees), and other metrics. These derived metrics may be used to generate leaderboards and other comparative displays.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaderboards and Public Statistics</strong>: To display rankings and statistics for both users and servers, such as total events hosted, average attendance, user recruitment, and experience points (XP). These statistics may be shared within the Discord server through public leaderboards or other displays.</li>
            <li><strong>Roblox Group Association and Promotions</strong>: To track Roblox group membership and promote attendees who have reached a new rank based on event participation or other criteria. This includes the automated promotion of users within Roblox groups based on rank progression.</li>
            <li><strong>Role-Rank Links</strong>: To manage and update user roles in Discord based on their Roblox rank, ensuring consistency between Roblox ranks and corresponding Discord roles.</li>
            <li><strong>Channel-Function Links</strong>: To ensure that specific bot functions (such as sending event logs or other notifications) are directed to the correct Discord channels as configured by the server owner.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or trade any personal or server data with third parties, except in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent</strong>: We will only share data if you give explicit consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance</strong>: If required by law, we may disclose data in response to a valid legal process.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Leaderboards and Statistics</strong>: User and server statistics such as event attendance, hosting, recruitment, average attendance, and experience points (EXP) may be displayed publicly within the Discord server in the form of leaderboards or other statistical summaries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Data is stored for as long as necessary to provide the services offered by the bot. Server owners may request the deletion of specific data by contacting the bot owner.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, we will notify users within the bot or through a server announcement.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the data collected by the Division Event Logger, please contact the bot owner Ererej on discord.</p>
